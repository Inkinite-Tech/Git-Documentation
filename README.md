# Git-Documentation
A getting stated git documentation for beginners

git-clone - Clone a repository into a new directory

> Clones a repository into a newly created directory
> Creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository
> Is visible using git branch -r 
> After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update all the remote-tracking branches
> Similarly the git pull without arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into the current master branch (if any)

git-stash

> Stashing takes the dirty state of our working directory which is the modified tracked files and staged changes 
> This saves it on a stack of unfinished changes and can be reapplied any time.
> git -stash is maily helpful when we are working on projects where we need to shift branches and in this instances we dont want to commit any half-done work just so that we acn come back and finish that part of job later so the git-stash is the solution for these kind of issues.
> To push a new stash onto the stack we need to run git stash
> When we want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but also want to go back to a clean working directory we acn make use of stash
> This command will save any local modifications made .
> To see which stashes youâ€™ve stored, you can use git stash list
